'drtool is for moving your wiki documents between googlecode projects.\n\ndrtool actually does three things:\n  - copy all of your wiki documentation between googlecode projects. This is\n    done via the "copy" command. References to a project will be changed during\n    the move.\n\n  - tell you what wiki pages are not referenced by your docreader-enabled\n    TableOfContents page. Use "nothave" or "orphans" or "list-orphans" for\n    this.\n\n  - find all of the http references to your subversion repository in your wiki\n    docs. "references" or "refs".\n\nIt\'s assumed that you have svn checkouts of both projects.\n'
